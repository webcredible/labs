  <div class="large4 small4 col">
    <p>1 <strong>Generate many ideas</strong>. <br>Post ideas in the kitchen whiteboard, anything that you consider interesting. Remeber, just because you posted something doesn't mean you're responsible for developing it! Others may kidnap and expand your idea.</p>

    <p>2 <strong>Elevator pitch</strong>.<br>2 minutes each idea, to explain why is good, how is going to make Webcredible famous, and the design/build feasability.</p>
    <p>When: <strong>Friday 6th February</strong></p>
    <p>Download the <a href="assets/Labs-proposition_canvas_v1.pptx">proposition canvas</a> to brainstorm ideas.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="large4 small4 col">
    <p>3 <strong>Pitch to the Dragon's Den</strong>. <br>The selected ideas will have 5 man-days to get ready, and then 20 minutes to pitch to Trenton, Pete, Gemma and Nirish.</p>
    <p>Sell it! Tell them who's going to work on it, the plan, the milestones. How are you going to promote it. Your partners <em>(if you have any)</em>, risks, etc.</p>
    <p>When: <strong>Friday 20th February</strong></p>

<div class="row">
  <h3>And then, how do we develop it?</h3>
  <p>We plan to announced the winning idea the Monday 23rd February. Then you'll have at least 30 man-days to create and launch that idea. How you spend that time is up to you (remember, you're presenting a plan to the panel!). On top of that, you can use the Marketing team to promote it. If you need expernal resources, just pitch for it. </p>
  <p>And remember, <strong>the mentors are here to help you make this a reality.</strong></p>
